Provide an example of the risk (eg, second wave of COVID) and the strategy that you would implement. \r\n\r\nThe project’s final deadline is nearing, and it is possible that the project will not be complete unless an unethical alternative suggested by one of the team members is implemented.  What is your approach to tackle this situation? ', 'Prioritise the tasks.   Needs to drive everything. Start at the top of the list and begin allocating work from there. That list should be based on the team’s and the organization’s goals. This has to be the first consideration in terms of how you distribute work. If a project is a top priority and somebody is available to do that work, they should be tasked with that work. \r\n\r\nSkill Sets - Evaluate the skill set of the people who you’re thinking about distributing the work to. If they have the right skill set, you’re going to get a high quality result. The end product will be something that meets your customer’s needs. This also reduces the likelihood of people failing because you’re not giving them work that they don’t have the skill set to perform. You’re giving them something they can be successful with. \r\n\r\nUndertaking Performance Management with individuals will provide insight to their goals.  Be transparent and communicate that they have been singled out as a protégé, but don’t make any guarantees as the situation can change due to circumstances.  Invest in the professional development of those that you select as a successor. '),

I would change the meetings to a suitable medium (continue with virtual meetings) but have more check-ins with individual team members to ensure that they don’t feel isolated. \r\n\r\nReiterate the code of conduct and organization policy to the entire team. Be firm about not following that path and counsel the individual member. '),
(9, 'Question 9  \r\nTeamwork Challenges ', 'Cohesive teams are better able to accomplish tasks, solve problems and create innovation.  As a team leader describe several strategies that you will use to develop team cohesion and effectiveness in your project team. ', 'Communicate with your staff \r\n\r\nBe clear with your staff about the purpose of their work, expectations and common goals. You can easily achieve this by having regular office meetings and coming up with a mission statement for your office that encourages a team mentality. By not communicating with employees, you increase the risk of misunderstanding, assumptions, apathy and lack of loyalty. \r\n\r\nCommit to staff development \r\n\r\nSavvy business leaders are always putting resources towards the continued education of their staff members, and helping to develop their skills that will enhance their value to the team. Sending your staff (and yourself) to seminars on communication, emotional intelligence, team building and leadership training are worthwhile as well. Remember to follow up on these courses by giving staff your ongoing support by ensuring employees use their new skills, encouraging them to be proactive, and implementing effective new policies. \r\n\r\nOffer feedback \r\n\r\nYour staff members should always know where they stand with respect to your company, and by providing them with both casual and formal evaluation you will effectively be showing them that they’re valued, respected and that their work is acknowledged. Many business owners make the mistake of only providing feedback when it’s negative, but providing plenty of positive feedback will build the confidence of your staff members and will make it more effective when you do need to criticise. \r\n\r\nEncourage collaboration \r\n\r\nEvery office needs some collaboration among staff members in order to make the work happen, but there are plenty of benefits to making that collaboration more effective. By creating a space where employees can get to know each other — even if they don’t work closely that often — then you will create a space that is more comfortable and that encourages more creative thinking and brainstorming. Having staff members that know each other and that work well together means that better work will get done more quickly, and more innovation will come of it. \r\n\r\nBe consistent \r\n\r\nNo matter how many staff members you have, it’s important that you try to be consistent in your decision-making. Having strong office policies means you don’t “play favourites” and you treat each employee the same, which will make them all feel more valued. Communicate decisions clearly and openly so that everyone knows them at the same time, and handle similar situations involving staff members the same way every time so that each employee knows they are as important. \r\n\r\nStrong teams don’t just appear magically, as you have to work hard to improve communication and respect amongst your staff members. If you really work at it, don’t be surprised if you start noticing positive changes quickly. ');
